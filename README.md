## Launching the game
To launch the game, execute the run.bat file and the game will run. A valid JDK distribution is required.

## Game instructions
Use WASD or the arrow keys to dodge the falling enemies. There is a timer which counts down, and every enemy you touch reduces the timer by 10.
Increase the timer by collecting stars or by using the Stopwatch power up.

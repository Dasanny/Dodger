## Launching the game
To launch the game, execute the run.bat file and the game will run. A valid JDK distribution is required.

Increase the timer by collecting stars or by using the Stopwatch power up.

### Items
- Ice: Slows down all enemies on screen
- Reduce: Removes all enemies on screen
- Jordans: Increase movement speed
- Stopwatch: Increase time by 10 seconds

### Enemies
- Green: The standard enemy. Mediocre speed and size
- Yellow: A large rectangle that hovers and rapidly falls after a delay
- Red: A fast diamond that moves in a diagonal, usually in a group
